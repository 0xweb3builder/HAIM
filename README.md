# HAIM
This repository contains the code to replicate the data processing, modeling and reporting of our Holistic AI in Medicine (HAIM) Publication in Nature Digital Medicine (Soenksen LR, Ma Y, Zeng C et al. 2022). 


Code is separated into three sections: 
1 - Data Preprocessing
2 - Modeling of our three tasks: mortality prediction, length of stay prediction, disease classification
3 - Result Generating: Including reporting of the AUCROC, AUCPR, F1 scores, as well as code to generate the plots reported in the paper
